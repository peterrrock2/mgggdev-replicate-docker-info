# Multi Scale Map Sampler

This project is cloned from the 
[original project](https://git.math.duke.edu/gitlab/quantifyinggerrymandering/multiscalemapsampler-public) 
from the team at Duke to make it easier to modify the code for our use case
and so that, in the event that we do change the code, the changes can be easily
traced.
