//! Runners for ReCom.
//!
//! A runner orchestrates the various components of the ReCom algorithm
//! (spanning tree generation, etc.) and handles setup, output, the
//! collection of auxiliary statistics, and (optionally) multithreading.
//!
//! Currently, there is only one runner ([`multi_chain`]). This runner
//! is multithreaded and prints accepted proposals to `stdout` in TSV format.
//! It also collects rejection/self-loop statistics.
